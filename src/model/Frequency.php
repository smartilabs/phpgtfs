	 *     0 or (empty) - Frequency-based trips are not exactly scheduled. This is the default behavior.
	 *     1 - Frequency-based trips are exactly scheduled. For a frequencies.txt row, trips are scheduled starting with trip_start_time = start_time + x * headway_secs for all x in (0, 1, 2, ...) where trip_start_time < end_time.
	 * The value of exact_times must be the same for all frequencies.txt rows with the same trip_id. If exact_times is 1 and a frequencies.txt row has a start_time equal to end_time, no trip must be scheduled. When exact_times is 1, care must be taken to choose an end_time value that is greater than the last desired trip start time but less than the last desired trip start time + headway_secs.
