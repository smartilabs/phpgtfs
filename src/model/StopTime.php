	 * The arrival_time specifies the arrival time at a specific stop for a specific trip on a route. The time is measured from "noon minus 12h" (effectively midnight, except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur) at the beginning of the service date. For times occurring after midnight on the service date, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. If you don't have separate times for arrival and departure at a stop, enter the same value for arrival_time and departure_time.
	 * If this stop isn't a time point, use an empty string value for the arrival_time and departure_time fields. Stops without arrival times will be scheduled based on the nearest preceding timed stop. To ensure accurate routing, please provide arrival and departure times for all stops that are time points. Do not interpolate stops.
	 * You must specify arrival and departure times for the first and last stops in a trip.
	 * Times must be eight digits in HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted, if the hour begins with 0). Do not pad times with spaces. The following columns list stop times for a trip and the proper way to express those times in the arrival_time field:
	 * Note: Trips that span multiple dates will have stop times greater than 24:00:00. For example, if a trip begins at 10:30:00 p.m. and ends at 2:15:00 a.m. on the following day, the stop times would be 22:30:00 and 26:15:00. Entering those stop times as 22:30:00 and 02:15:00 would not produce the desired results.

For example, if a bus travels a distance of 5.25 kilometers from the start of the shape to the stop, the shape_dist_traveled for the stop ID would be entered as "5.25". This information allows the trip planner to determine how much of the shape to draw when showing part of a trip on the map. The values used for shape_dist_traveled must increase along with stop_sequence: they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route.

	 * The timepoint field can be used to indicate if the specified arrival and departure times for a stop are strictly adhered to by the transit vehicle or if they are instead approximate and/or interpolated times. The field allows a GTFS producer to provide interpolated stop times that potentially incorporate local knowledge, but still indicate if the times are approximate. For stop-time entries with specified arrival and departure times, valid values for this field are:
	 *     empty - Times are considered exact.
	 *     0 - Times are considered approximate.
	 *     1 - Times are considered exact.
	 * For stop-time entries without specified arrival and departure times, feed consumers must interpolate arrival and departure times. Feed producers may optionally indicate that such an entry is not a timepoint (value=0) but it is an error to mark a entry as a timepoint (value=1) without specifying arrival and departure times.
